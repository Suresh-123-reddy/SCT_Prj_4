# SCT_Prj_4

SCT_DS_4-Task4

🔍 Analysis of the Project:

✅ 1. Objective

To analyze road traffic accident data and identify patterns, trends, and contributing factors to accidents. The project aims to derive actionable insights for improving road safety by performing data preprocessing, visualization, and possibly predictive modeling on accident data.

🛠 2. Skills Applied

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Data Visualization

Statistical Analysis

Machine Learning (if applicable)

Python Programming

📊 3. Dataset

Original Dataset (RTA Dataset.csv)

Likely contains raw data of road traffic accidents with features like accident severity, date, time, location, vehicle type, driver demographics, etc.

Cleaned Dataset (cleaned.csv)

Contains the processed version of the original dataset: missing values handled, categorical variables encoded, and irrelevant features removed.

🧰 4. Tools & Libraries

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas – data manipulation

numpy – numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn – data visualization

scikit-learn – machine learning & preprocessing

datetime – date and time parsing

📈 5. Results

Cleaned dataset with structured, usable data.

Visualizations showing accident distributions (by time, severity, location, etc.)

Possibly built a prediction model for accident severity (if included).

Insights like peak accident hours, high-risk driver groups, and frequent accident locations.

📁 6. Files
